## Shared packages (git submodule)

Shared packages live in a sparse submodule:

```
packages/global-packages/          # submodule → blockeraai/blockera-global-packages
  packages/                        # only tree checked out (sparse)
    autoloader-coordinator/
    editor/
    ...
```

Pro-only packages live in this submodule under `packages/` (`*-pro*`, including `console-pro`, `guard-pro`, `validator-pro`). Other products sparse-checkout the same tree but do not npm/Composer `require` those packages. Free-plugin CI uses `BLOCKERA_E2E_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES` (and CT/Playwright equivalents) so Pro specs do not run there.

### Local setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <blockera-pro-url>
cd blockera-pro
# If you cloned without --recurse-submodules:
git submodule update --init packages/global-packages
bash .github/actions/ensure-global-packages/ensure.sh
# or (after submodule content exists):
# bash packages/global-packages/packages/dev-tools/github/scripts/ensure-global-packages-sparse.sh

composer install
npm ci
```

npm `file:` deps and Composer path repos point at `packages/global-packages/packages/*` for shared packages.

### Updating shared packages (automated)

Master pins are automated; **feature-branch pins are local**.

1. Push to `blockeraai/blockera-global-packages` (any branch).
2. That repo’s `notify-blockera-submodule` workflow reads `.github/global-packages-consumers.json` and dispatches `global-packages-updated` to every enabled consumer.
3. This repo’s `sync-global-packages-submodule` workflow:
   - **master** → opens/updates PR `chore/bump-global-packages`
   - **matching feature branch** (created by Husky mirror) → **skipped**. Pin locally with `npm run submodule:bump` (not auto-pushed to origin).
4. Manual remote catch-up: Actions → **Sync global-packages submodule** (`workflow_dispatch` with `mode=pr` or `mode=push`), or wait for the daily schedule (master only).

Feature-branch gitlink bump (commits **locally**, does not `git push`; uncommitted submodule files are kept after the GP pin lands):

```bash
npm run submodule:bump                 # advance current pin’s branch tip and commit
npm run submodule:bump -- fix/issues   # or any branch / SHA (explicit override)
```

Push this repo yourself when you are ready.

Shared CI composites/scripts live in `packages/global-packages/packages/dev-tools/github/`.
Pro workflows pass scan/package knobs via `env:` / action `with:` (e.g.
`BLOCKERA_E2E_PACKAGE_SUFFIX=-pro`, zip `blockera-pro.zip`). There is no
product-style switch.

Consumer bootstrap (must exist before the submodule is available):

```bash
bash packages/global-packages/packages/dev-tools/github/scripts/sync-consumer-bootstrap.sh
```

Husky `post-checkout` mirrors new consumer branches into the submodule as `<repo>/<branch>` (from the `origin` remote name).

Husky `pre-push` verifies the pinned `packages/global-packages` SHA exists on origin (and pushes the mirrored submodule branch when needed). Skip with `BLOCKERA_SKIP_SUBMODULE_PUSH=1`.

CI does **not** use `actions/checkout` `submodules:`. Workflows call
`.github/actions/ensure-global-packages` with `secrets.BLOCKERABOT_PAT`, then invoke
toolkit `setup-node` / `setup-php` / job scripts.

**Note:** `repository_dispatch` only runs workflows that exist on this repo’s **default branch**.
